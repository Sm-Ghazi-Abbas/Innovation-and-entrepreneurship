# 🚗 Uni-Pool: Verified Student Carpooling Network

> **"Travel with Trust. Commute with Barakah."**

## 📖 Overview
**Uni-Pool** is a mobile application concept designed to solve the daily commuting crisis for university students. By connecting students from the same university who live in the same neighborhoods, we create a secure, verified, and cost-effective carpooling community.

Unlike public ride-hailing apps, Uni-Pool requires strictly verified student identities, ensuring a safe environment for everyone—especially female students.

## 🚀 The Problem
- [cite_start]**High Costs:** Daily rides on services like Indrive/Uber cost 500-1000 PKR, which is unsustainable for students[cite: 11].
- [cite_start]**Safety Concerns:** Informal WhatsApp groups lack verification, posing risks for female commuters[cite: 12].
- [cite_start]**Inefficiency:** Public transport is often overcrowded and unreliable[cite: 10].

## 💡 Key Features
- [cite_start]**🔐 Strict Verification:** Sign up requires a valid `.edu` email or student ID scan[cite: 18].
- [cite_start]**📍 Smart Matching:** GPS algorithms match drivers and passengers based on location and class schedules[cite: 21].
- **🌸 Pink-Pool (Female Safety):** A dedicated feature ensuring female students are matched exclusively with other females.
- [cite_start]**💸 Cost Splitting:** Built-in calculator to fairly split fuel costs between riders[cite: 26].
- **🤝 Network on the Go:** Turns travel time into networking opportunities for students to share ideas and projects.
- **🌍 Eco-Friendly:** Reduces carbon footprint by filling empty seats.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- [cite_start]**Design & Prototyping:** Figma (High-fidelity wireframes & mockups)[cite: 28].
- [cite_start]**Proposed Development:** Flutter (Cross-platform mobile app)[cite: 30].
- **Backend (Planned):** Firebase / Node.js.
